### GETX INTRO
- GetX is fast, stable, extra-light and powerful Flutter framework for
1. State Management
2. Dependency Injection
3. Route Management

### Three basic Principle of GetX

1. __Performance__ : GetX is focused on performance and minimum consumption of resources. When  compared to other state management library , GetX wins the race.


2. __Productivity__ : GetX has a very easy syntax and saves lot of development time and hence increases productivity.


3. __Organization__ : GetX organizes the code by decoupling of the View, presentation logic, business logic, dependency injection, and navigation

### Pillars of GetX

1. __State Management__ : GetX has two different state managers  
   Simple State Manager(GetBuilder)
   Reactive State Manager(GetX)

2. __Route Management__ : If we are using routes/snackbars/dialogs/bottomsheets  then GetX is excellent because the mentioned features can be used without using context.


3. __Dependency Management__ : GetX has powerful dependency manager that allows us to retrieve the controller by 1 line of code without using Provider Context or InheritedWidget
